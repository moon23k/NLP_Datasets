**Deep learning models are inevitably data dependent.**  

**In other words, obtaining good data is the first step in building a good AI Service.**

**In this repo, we look at the Bench Mark data in representative NLP tasks,**

**and implement the source code that can be used for model training.**

**The directory structure includes reference codes for each NLP task and overall data preprocessing PipeLine for reference.**
