pitch at villa park after aston villa beat west brom in the fa cup . the last time england played ireland in dublin in 1995 the game was abandoned due to crowd trouble . the game in 1995 was marred by crowd violence and was called off after 22 minutes . the two sides met at wembley for a friendly in 2013 when they played out a 1-1 draw . after intense negotiations with police, the kick-off time has now been brought forward to 1pm. why is it being played at all? there are 209 member associations of fifa, which means there are 207 countries that england could play without fear of significant disturbance, and one where england\u2019s last visit was abandoned due to a riot. if a free draw sends england back to dublin, both sides will have to handle it \u2014 but this is an unnecessary risk,
